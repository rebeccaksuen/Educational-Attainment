                <p>
                    This project is for UCLA AA191A - Web Development and GIS for Social Change. For this project, we survey first-generation Pilipinx students using Google Forms. This data was organized in Google Sheets. For our webpage, we use open source software including Leaflet and Papaparse as well as HTML, Javascript, and CSS.
