# Project: Educational Attainment for First Gen

## Our project aims to empower students whose parents did not attend college in the US by mapping their access to college resources. Issues we could face include reaching a large sample and creating a map with appropriate scale. We plan on contacting the AAP program at UCLA, SPEAR, and SPACE in order to facilitate community-engaged mapmaking.
