# Project: Educational Attainment 

## Our project aims to empower Pilipinx students whose parents did not attend college by amplifying their voices as they raise issues they face relating to educational attainment due to their parents' lack of higher education. Issues we could face include reaching a large sample and creating a map with appropriate scale. We are working with SPEAR in order to help first-generation Pilipinx students find community where they may feel supported, and create and advocate for resources to help with student retention.
